# A Next.js App Running On AWS Lambda (`export` mode)

![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/scaffoldly/scaffoldly-examples/scaffoldly.yml?branch=node-nextjs-export&link=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fscaffoldly%2Fscaffoldly-examples%2Factions)

## âœ¨ Quickstart

Run the following command to create your own copy of this application:

```bash
npx scaffoldly create app --template node-nextjs-export
```

## Manual Setup

This application was generated with the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest node-nextjs-export
```

âœ¨ No modifications or SDKs were made or added to the code to "make it work" in AWS Lambda.

### Working example

[https://jtzom2obx3owx4gn4vluichvze0frzcn.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws](https://jtzom2obx3owx4gn4vluichvze0frzcn.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws)

## First, [`next.config.mjs`](next.config.mjs) was updated

We've set `output` to be [`export`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/output):

- `export` mode creates a Single Page Application (SPA) with no backend
- The `next` binary is no longer needed to start the app

```js
const nextConfig = {
  output: "export",
};
```

## Then, Scaffoldly Config was added...

In the project's [`package.json`](package.json) file, the `scaffoldly` configuration was added:

- The `serve` binary is installed to serve the static HTML
- The `start` command now uses `serve out` to serve the static HTML

```jsonc
{
  "name": "node-nextjs-export",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  // ... snip ...
  "scaffoldly": {
    "runtime": "node:22-alpine",
    "handler": "localhost:3000",
    "packages": ["npm:serve"],
    "services": [
      {
        "name": "next",
        "files": ["package.json", ".next", "out", "package-lock.json"],
        "scripts": {
          "install": "npm ci",
          "dev": "next dev",
          "build": "next build",
          "start": "serve out"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

See the [Scaffoldly Docs](https://scaffoldly.dev/docs/config/) for additional configuration directives.

## Then, deployed to AWS Lambda

```bash
npx scaffoldly deploy
```

See the [Scaffoldly Docs](https://scaffoldly.dev/docs/cli/#scaffoldly-deploy) for details on the `scaffoldly deploy` command.

### After deploy the app is available on a public URL

```bash
ðŸš€ Deployment Complete!
   ðŸ†” App Identity: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/node-nextjs-export-c2f26520
   ðŸ“„ Env Files: .env.main, .env

   ðŸŒŽ URL: https://jtzom2obx3owx4gn4vluichvze0frzcn.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws
```

## GitHub Action added for CI/CD

A [`scaffoldly.yml`](.github/workflows/scaffoldly.yml) was added to `.github/workflows` so that a push will trigger a deploy

```
name: Scaffoldly Deploy

# ... snip ...

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Deploy
        uses: scaffoldly/scaffoldly@v1
        with:
          secrets: ${{ toJSON(secrets) }}
```
